# We will upload the specific index PDF manually or include it if not confidential, 
# but usually large files or sensitive data should be handled carefully.
# For this task, the user wants to use the PDF "HPLC_001-030_문서요약_인덱스.pdf".
# If it's internal company data, be careful. 
# However, for Streamlit Cloud to work, the PDF *must* be in the repo 
# UNLESS we use a cloud storage URL.
# Given the user context, they probably need to upload it to the private repo.
# So I will NOT ignore the specific PDF, but I WILL ignore .env.

# Ignore system files
